# Object counter
In this project, we can count objects from a given video. 
An object is counted by a reference line. when an object passes a reference line we can count them. 
By this reference line, we can calculate object direction which helps us to determine
whether an object is in or out of direction.


### Usages:
Add your video to the videos folder and add the file name in the object_count.py file. 
Adjust your line and circle position by editing the config.yaml file. 

### Here is an Example output.
